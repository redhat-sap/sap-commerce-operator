# What is this about

This repository contains the code to build a Kubernetes Operator for the SAP Hybris component of SAP Commerce (SAP C/4HANA).

## Supportability

This Operator will deploy an opinionated deployment of SAP Hybris, which is **not supported for Production**. The goal of the repository is to demonstrate how to enable SAP Business applications like SAP Commerce to be automatically deployed and managed in a Kubernetes cluster using the [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) approach.
